#labels Android,Suspendresume
=How to make suspend/resume to work=
  * change kernel/power/wake_lock.c function to remove the entry_event_num check at the end of suspend function
  * rebuild kernel (see [BuildAndroidForX86Platforms#How_to_rebuild_kernel here] for details)
  * add acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode in kernel command line
    eg, in grub.cfg (assume you are using grub2) :
   {{{
    menuentry "Android Vesa 9xx" {
            insmod 915resolution
            915resolution 45 1024 600
            linux /boot/kernel-vesa root=/dev/sdc2 rootdelay=6 rw init=/init androidboot.hardware=eee_701 vga=791 acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode
    }
   }}}
  * boot android and set screen timeout to whatever value you want.
  * wait machine to suspend.
  * use fn + f6 to wake up the machine.

NOTE: you can wake up your machine by hit on any key. Somehow, on my 1000H, the screen brightness is set to the lowest level after the machine resumed. I have to use fn+f6 to turn the brightness back on.
